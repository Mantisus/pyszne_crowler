A small experimental web scraping project.
​
The target site is https://www.pyszne.p
​
Task is to get contact details of all restaurants in Poland
​
The target site uses Cloudflare protection with rather poor settings. The pages protected by Cloudflare can be bypassed with correct headers and httpx.
​
Another feature of the site is the switch to cw-api.takeaway for internal product pages. For cw-api.takeaway pages, the user agent validator is poorly implemented. The use of invalid useragents avoids the protection of IP - User Agent mapping constraint checks. But increased server load will result in IP restriction of requests. Hence one way to develop IP connectivity.
​
Script can be accelerated using proxy, but avoid unnecessary load on site if you don't have to.
​
Navigation pages are cached because they are rarely changed data. But there is no caching for the regions page, because this content changes more often.
​
If you plan to use the script for research or learning, please use url_cache decorator for request function. This will consume more than 30 gigabytes of disk space, but you won't create an increased load on the target site.
​
One aim of the experiment is to create a fully asynchronous script, the synchronisation of execution is done by checking the number of tasks in the event pool.
